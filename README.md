# The Developer Software Knowledge Base

This is a curated list of useful knowledge tidbits and commands compiled over the years 👨‍🎓 I figured it is best to put them in a repo where I and other folk will find them useful 🕵️‍♀️ Often times I find myself with an ever expanding unsaved text file in Sublime which I inevitably close accidentally.
