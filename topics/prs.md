# Pull Requests

## Best Practices

### Images

Attaching an image or two to your pull request gives reviewers the confidence your work is compiling and running on your machine. It also gives a bit more context what the code is trying to perform. On github you can directly paste an image from your clipboard onto the markdown text editor. It will look something like this

```
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2873559/139231854-591d287e-87a0-4103-b985-62c745819d29.png)
```

If you want to resize the image then convert it into a `<img>` tag and give it `width` or `height`

```html
<img
  src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2873559/139231854-591d287e-87a0-4103-b985-62c745819d29.png"
  width="500"
/>
```
